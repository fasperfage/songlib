# songlib

This is a class project for Software Methodology (CS213) at Rutgers University,
and was written by Calvin Lee and Bartosz Kidacki

The goal of the project is to build a simple graphical user interface for a 
song library that contains a list of songs. The GUI implements three functions:
Add, Delete, Edit.

The song list file must be in CSV format, and must be titled "songs.csv"
If the file does not exist, it will create a new file.
